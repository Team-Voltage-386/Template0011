# Template0011
 Carl's experiment with designing a new robot template.
 
 The system uses a routine based system, and is designed for non-blocking continous operations. It also fixes the issues that arise from having the subsystems dynamically typed, by making them statically typed.
 
 The idea being that this will make programming more intuitive for future students.
 
 Use the Robo0011 repo as an example. It is working robot software for the TyRapXXII Robot.
